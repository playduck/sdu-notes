\emph{Neurons} collect electrical signals to process and transmit to
other \emph{neurons}. \emph{Axon} terminals of one connect to
\emph{dendrites} of other \emph{neurons}. \emph{Synapses} are structures
to connect those electrically/chemically (however no physical connetion
is made).

Voltage changes open Voltage gates from the neural-fluid into the
\emph{presynaptic neuron}. This pulls in Ions from the neuralfluid maing
\emph{vesicles} release realese \emph{neurotransmitteres} into the
\emph{synaptic cleft} to move between the \emph{neurons}. The

\item
  \emph{Depolarization phase}: Excitation from input signal reaching an
  artificial threshold resulting in a voltage jump (up to
  \(+40\si{mV}\))
\item
  \emph{Repolarization phase}: Return to resting potential

  \emph{Undershoot (Hyperpolarization)} return to resting.
\end{itemize}

All voltages with respect to outside brainfluid.

This process thakes around \(3\si{ms}\ \left( 333.33\si{Hz} \right)\).
The \emph{Myelin Sheaths} decreases performance and throughput aswell.
This is faster due to thight packing and parallel processing.

The spike is seemingly identical between different neurons (same
Amplitude and timeframe).

\hypertarget{resting-membrane-potential-default-state}{%
\subsubsection{Resting membrane potential (default
state)}\label{resting-membrane-potential-default-state}}

Different ion concentration: more negative inside the neuron than
outside. Measurement in reference to outside. Outside: Mostly
\(\mathit{Na}+\) and \(\textit{Cl}-\). Inside: \(\mathit{K}+\) and
\(\mathit{A}-\). Resting voltage sits at around
\(-65\si{mV} \text{ to } -70\si{mV}\).

\hypertarget{de-polarization}{%
\subsubsection{De-polarization}\label{de-polarization}}

Ions flow through the neuron. Signal excites gates. Gates are
ion-specific and only allow certain kinds of ions. These are
\emph{voltage-gates channels}.

Ions like Sodium (\(\mathit{Na}+\)) enter the neuron resulting in a
positive voltage swing up to \(+40\si{mV}\). Once all Sodium gates are
open the threshold is reached. The gates open with very little voltage.

\hypertarget{hyper-polarization}{%
\subsubsection{Hyper-polarization}\label{hyper-polarization}}

Once the voltage between neuron and outside fluid is positive, the
Sodium gates close (as they're voltage controlled). Respectively the
Potassium (\(\mathit{K}+\)) gates open. Positive charge leaves the
neuron making the voltage drop to below the threshold. At resting
potential the Potassium gates close. Due to the delay in closure
undershoot occurs.

\hypertarget{encoding-information}{%

\hypertarget{perceptrons}{%
\subsubsection{Perceptrons}\label{perceptrons}}

A simple neural model.

All dendrites \(u_i\) get weighted \(w_i\) and summed resulting in the
activation \(z\). The summation simulates the \emph{soma} core.
\[z = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \omega_i \cdot u_i\]

The threshold and axiom are simulated by an activation function \(\phi\)
resulting in the \emph{perceptrons'} output \(v\). \[v = \phi(z)\]

Activation functions tend to clamp the output in the range of \(-1\) to
\(1\).

An activation function dictates the output space. A heaviside function
can only output a binary result. Functions with infinite range may
diverge. Sigmoid functions can't overflow however the may saturate. The
computataional cost is quite prohibitive.

\textbf{Neuroplasticity}: Ability for the brain to re-organize itself in

``\emph{learning}'' and is happening continuously.

\textbf{HFS}: \(100\) Pulses (over \(1\si{s} \rightarrow 100\si{Hz}\))
as an input to a neuron. The neuron is resting at \(t=0\). The
\textbf{HFS} hits the neuron resulting in an instantaneous output, the
\textbf{LTP}. The neurons output jumps, then receedes and continues to
saturate (Only as long as the \textbf{HFS} is continous.) The
\textbf{synaptic strength} is the chance the output is increased.

A lot of fast input \(\rightarrow\) Big changes and high learning

\textbf{LTP \emph{increases} synaptic strength}

\hypertarget{long-term-depressino-ltd}{%

The Inverse, to decrease the \textbf{synaptic strength} an \textbf{LFS}
(\(900\) Pulses \(15\si{min} \rightarrow 1\si{Hz}\)) is sent. The neuron
responsds, dips and saturates in a depression.

Low data \(\rightarrow\) Low learning

\textbf{LTD \emph{decreases} synaptic stregth}

\hypertarget{chemical-basis}{%

\textbf{LTP} and \textbf{LTD} result in synapeses by creating or

\hypertarget{hebbian-learning-model}{%
\subsection{Hebbian learning model}\label{hebbian-learning-model}}

Efficiency describes the likelyhood if a presynaptic neuron spiking and
exciting it's postsynaptic neuron. The likelyhood of the post-synaptic
neuron firing after having been exicted is increased. More firing
together \(\rightarrow\) more likely to fire together in the future.
They spiking is, however, \emph{not necessarily causal}. At high
efficiency the spiking of both neurons are \textbf{temporally
correlated}. The spiking is \textbf{associative} and
\textbf{unsupervised}.

\textbf{Neurons that fire together, wire together.}

\hypertarget{simple-mathematical-model}{%

\[\frac{\mathit{d}\omega_1}{\mathit{d}t} = \mu \cdot v \cdot u_1\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(\omega\): dsecribes the synaptic strength / weight
\item
  \(\frac{\mathit{d}\omega_1}{\mathit{d}t}\): (not a derivative), Change
  in synaptic weight
\item
  \(\mu\): Learnig rate (\(\mu \ll 1\) to avoid ``exploding learning
  problem'')
\item
  \(v\): Output of post-synaptic neuron
\item
  \(u_1\): Output of pre-synaptic neuron / input to post-synaptic neuron
\end{itemize}

\[\omega_n = \omega_{n-1} + \frac{\mathit{d}\omega_{n-1}}{\mathit{d}t} = \omega_{n-1} + \mu \cdot v \cdot u_{n-1} \]

\textbf{Problem}: \(\omega_1\) is always increasing, unstable \sout{but
biologically correct}. This is an open control loop.

As this is unsupervised we don't have an error term and can't simply
stop when the model is ``good enough''.

\hypertarget{ltp}{%
\subsubsection{LTP}\label{ltp}}

The further the amount of time between two spikes firing the more the
weight changes. A high \(\delta t\) results in little change, a small
\(\delta t\) results in large changes. At \(\delta t = 0\) maximal
change occurs. The simple model only results in positive change, thus
unstable.

\hypertarget{input-correlation-learning-ico}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Input correlation learning
(\emph{ICO})}{Input correlation learning (ICO)}}\label{input-correlation-learning-ico}}

Learning rule
\[\frac{\delta w_a}{\delta t} = \eta \cdot f \left( A, t\right) \otimes \frac{\delta f \left( B, t\right) }{\delta t}\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item

\item
  \(Y\): Neuron Ouput
\item
  \(w_a\) weight between \(A\) and \(Y\)
\item
  \(f\) output function of a neuron (including the sigmoid)
\end{itemize}

If we'd like to stop the learning we can assume \(B\) to be constant. We
cannot guarantee \(B \rightarrow 0\) (to stop learning) but we can take
the derivative to stop learning once stimulus ceases change.

This Algorithm \textbf{will converge} to the correct weight.

Output signal is the weighted sum.
\[Y(t) = w_a \cdot f \left( A, t\right) + f \left( B, t\right)\]

\hypertarget{perceptron-learning}{%
\subsubsection{Perceptron learning}\label{perceptron-learning}}

Learning by updating input weights only. Update done using
\textbf{gradient descent}.

Update weight in proportion to contribution to the output. Contribution
is the change in error \(E\) für a given change in \(w\), where the mean
squared error is defined as \[E = \frac{1}{2} \left( t-v\right)^2\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(t\): target output
\item
  \(v\): actual output

\subsection{Non-linear actiavtion
function}\label{non-linear-actiavtion-function}}

\textbf{Bias} is activation function x-Offset \textbf{Slope} of
activation function is rarely used.

An example sigmoid with \textbf{bias} and \textbf{slope}.
\[v =  \frac{1}{1+e^{-S(z-b)}}\]

where \(b\) is \textbf{bias} and \(S\) the \textbf{slope}. \textbf{Bias}
can be used as a weight.

\begin{align*}
z &= w_1u_1 + w_2u_2 + \ldots + w_nu_n \\
& \rightarrow (z-b) = w_1u_1 + w_2u_2 + \ldots + w_nu_n - b\\
& \rightarrow (z-b) = w_1u_1 + w_2u_2 + \ldots + w_nu_n - (b-1)\\[2ex]
\rightarrow & (b-1) \text{ splits to } w_{n+1} \text{ and } u_{n+1}
\end{align*}

This results in an additional weighted bias shifting the activation
function resulting in \[z = \sum_{i=1}^{n+1}\omega_i \cdot u_i\]

Each perceptron can implement one \textbf{deciscion boundary}.
\textbf{Deciscion boundaries} seperate inputs into different classes.
The boundary can be shifted by adapting the weights.

By adding more perceptrons the \textbf{deciscion boundaries} dimension
increases. The boundry of 2 neurons results in one-dimensions. 3 Neurons
create a 2-Dimensional \textbf{deciscion boundary}. More Neurons build
more complex spaces.

\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{vanishing-gradients}{%
\subsection{Vanishing Gradients}\label{vanishing-gradients}}

With a great amount of layers the impact of early neurons (close to the
input) have less effect on the output error and get changed less
resulting in less learning. A high amount of layers does not guarantee
better network performance.

\textbf{Dropout} randomly disables neurons and stops updating their
weights. This does not guarantee better accuracy only better execution
speed.

This only occurs by learning with backpropagation.

Alternative: \textbf{NEAT} (\emph{Neuroevolution of augmenting
topologies}) using generative algorithms. Possibly (not guaranteed)
better performance to optimize output by chaning the entire networks
structure. Worst execution speed and memory performance.

\hypertarget{trainig-proceedure}{%

  This presents every datapoint equally often and fairly.

    The \textbf{resting phase} is the default state.
  \item
    The \textbf{depolarization phase} occurs once the \(Na+\) gates
    reach a voltage-threshold. A voltage overshoot occurs as reactions
    are not instantenous.
  \item
    The \textbf{repolarization phase} follows showing a decline in
    voltage as the Sodium gates saturate and repell ions, thus allowing
    Potassium (\(K+\)) to enter.
  \item
    The \textbf{hyperpolarization phase} returns to the resting state as
    the voltage reaches an equilibrium.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{What is resting
  potential/depolarisation/repolarisation/hyperpolarisation? What
  mechanism(s) causes each phase to be generated?}

  \textbf{See above answer}.
\item
  \emph{Why is the resting potential negative?}

  As ions leak through the neurons membrane the neuron takes on a more
  negative charge in respect to the outside fluid.
\item
  \emph{How is information encoded in spikes?}

  Presumeably in its frequency and timing charachteristics.
\item
  \emph{What is a perceptron?}

  A quantized model of a neurons behavior. Consisting of multiple
  weighted inputs getting summed and passed through an activation
  function.
\item
  \emph{What is an activation?}

  The activation describes the weighted sum of the perceptrons inputs.
  \(z = \sum_{i=1}^n \omega_i \cdot u_i\)
\item
  \emph{What is an activation function? Why do we need it/What will
  happen if I don't use it?}

  A mathematical function limiting the perceptrons activation (weighted
  sum) to a knwon output space.
\item
  \emph{What are the different types of activation functions and their
  advantages/drawbacks? Which one will you choose and why?}

  \begin{align*}
    \text{RelU } &= \begin{cases} 0 \text{ for } x < 0\\ x \text{ for } x \geq 0\end{cases}\\[2ex]
    \text{Heaviside } &= \begin{cases} 0 \text{ for } x < 0\\ 0.5 \text{ for } x = 0\\ 1 \text{ for } x > 0\end{cases}\\[2ex]
    \text{Linear } &= x\\
    \text{Sigmoid} &= \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}
    \end{align*}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Heaviside limits the output to a binary state, severly reducing
    granularity.
  \item
    Linear and RelU are computationally efficient but may grow
    unbounded.
  \item
    Sigmoids limit the effective range and don't quantize dramatically.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Why do we use a sigmoid activation function (think about it from
  both computer implementation and biology perspectives)?}

  It binds the output to a manageable range which avoids overflow and
  offers great precicion using IEE754. It also models neuron's own
  saturation.
\item
  \emph{What is the basic difference between biological neural
  processing and artificial neural processing?}

  Biological neural processing can operate many billions (or more)
  neurons in parallel. Computing with artifical neurons cannot currently
  achieve this.
\item
  \emph{What is a Hodgekin-Huxley model? What
  similarities/dissimilarities does it have with a biological neuron?
  What drawbacks does it have in terms of implementation?}

  An electronic circuit aiming to reproduce neurons' voltage spikes. It
  models different Ion-charges and resistances using batteries and
  resistors acting upon a cpacitor and receiving an external input.

  The model only offers one input. It breaks down with too-high currents
  failing to simulate accordingly.

  It's implementation is computationally incredibly expensive requring
  mutliple equations to be evaluated for every timestep of the voltage
  signal.

\subsection{Braitenberg vehicles}\label{braitenberg-vehicles-1}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{What is a Braitenberg vehicle? Can you give an example of one
  and how it behaves?}
\end{itemize}

A simple concept of a neurorobot consisting of two powered wheels
receiving input from two sensors placed at the top left and right of the
vehicle. The connections between the sensors and wheels dictate the
vehicles emerging behaviour.

An agressive vehicle features \textbf{contralateral} and
\textbf{excitatory} connetions and agressively manouvers towards the
sensor's gratests stimulus. The \glqq love\grqq vehicle consists of
\textbf{ipsilateral} and \textbf{inhibitory} connections resulting in it
seeking the source of gratests stimulus but slowly coming to a halt when
approaching it.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Are there any advantages of using Braitenberg vehicles?}
\end{itemize}

Their rather complex behavior emerging from very simplistic rules make
them computationally trivial.

They enable emulating behaviors of simple insects.
