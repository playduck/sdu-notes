# Introduction to biologically inspired robotics and deep learning at SDU

This is a repository for all my notes of the SDU summer school 2022's course of [biologically inspired robotics](https://web.archive.org/web/20220812084208/https://odin.sdu.dk/sitecore/index.php?a=fagbesk&id=97577&listid=11958&lang=en) by [Professor Danish Shaikh](linkedin.com/in/danish-shaikh-335ba046).

## Structure

- The notes are situtated in `./pdf/sdu`.
- All markdown sources are in `./markdown/sdu`.
- The intermediary TeX source files for backwards compatability are stored in `./tex/sdu`.
- The `./src` folder and root `./` contain useful scripts to create, compile, merge etc.
- Use `./src/aio.py` to build an *all-in-one* version of all notes.
